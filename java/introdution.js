//java script was introduted in 1995 by Brendon Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. 
// It was initially called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.
// JavaScript was created to add interactivity to web pages, allowing developers to create dynamic content.
// It was first implemented in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995.
// JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development.
// It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
// JavaScript is an event-driven, functional, and imperative language.
// It is a prototype-based language, meaning that it uses prototypes rather than classes for inheritance.
// JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
// JavaScript is standardized by the ECMAScript specification, which is maintained by TC39, a committee of the Ecma International standards organization.
// The first version of ECMAScript was released in 1997, and it has since gone through several revisions.
// The most widely used version of ECMAScript is ES5, which was released in 2009
// and introduced many new features, such as strict mode, JSON support, and new array methods.
// ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, was released in 2015 and introduced many new features,
// such as arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, and modules.
// Since then, ECMAScript has continued to evolve, with new features being added in annual releases.
// JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer.
// It can also be used on the server side with environments like Node.js.
// JavaScript has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, Vue.js, and jQuery,
// which make it easier to build complex web applications.
// JavaScript is also used in non-web environments, such as desktop applications (with Electron),
// mobile applications (with React Native), and even in game development (with libraries like Phaser).
// JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world,
// with a large and active community of developers.
// It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
